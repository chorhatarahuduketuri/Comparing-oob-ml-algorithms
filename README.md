# Comparing out-of-the-box machine learning algorithms on different types of datasets
How do different algorithms and models fare with different types of data?

## Types of data
To be specific, there are different types of data, and there are different types of datasets. 

Nominal, ordinal, numerical - discrete, numerical - continuous; these are examples of different types of data. 

Skewed, unbalanced, sparse, anomalous; these are attributes of datasets. 

This project aims to find out *in general* which algorithms perform well at modelling different types of data, **and** datasets with various attributes.
