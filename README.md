# Comparing out-of-the-box machine learning algorithms on different types of datasets
How do different algorithms and models fare with different types of data?

## Types of data
To be specific, there are different types of data, and there are different types of datasets. 

Nominal, ordinal, numerical - discrete, numerical - continuous; these are examples of different types of data. 

Skew, unbalanced, sparse, kurtosis; these are attributes of datasets or the features in those datasets. 

This project aims to find out *in general* which algorithms perform well at modelling different types of data, **and** datasets with various attributes. 

Broadly speaking, there are two types of data: **qualitative** and **quantitative**.  
**Qualitative** data describes the *qualities* of something, like it's category, colour or type (whether data is qualitative or quantitative is *qualitative* data about that data.)  
**Quantitative** is the *quantity* of something - how much of something there is, or how many. Count, price, and probability are all quantitative types of data. 

### Qualitative
Qualitative data can be further split into two subcategories: unordered (nominal) and ordered (ordinal). 

#### Nominal
Nominal means categories that aren't related to each other in any ordered way such as location, name or language. There's no implicit ordering between married, civil partnership, and single, or different manufacturers of cars. 

Note that while single categories can be predicted, all nominal data can be considered as technically binaric: it either *is* a thing, or it *is not* that thing, even if there are 15 'things'. It *is* one of them, and it *is not* 14 of them. 


#### Ordinal 
Ordinal means categories that have meanings relative to one another such as satisfaction, achievement level or rankings. Bad, OK, or good, and first, second, and third, are both examples of ordinal descriptors. 

Note that ordinal data can sometimes be very much like quantitative data, and quantitative data is often simplified into ordinal data. Income levels are an example of this (especially in anonymised data), where instead of a sample having the exact income specified (e.g. £23,450), each sample has which range of incomes it is in (e.g. between £20,000 and £29,999). Other common examples are age ranges (e.g. 0-17,18-25, 26-30, etc.), education levels (e.g. primary, secondary, undergraduate, postgraduate), and satisfaction on a tick box scale of 0-10. 

### Quantitative
Quantitiative data can be further split into 3 subcategories: discrete, continuous-interval, continuous-ratio. 

#### Discrete
Discrete data is something that can be meaningfully counted in integers, and not split further between integers. e.g. how many jelly beans (assuming no halves) in the jar? How many children do you have? How many units of product have been shipped? 

#### Continuous
Continuous data is numeric data that can take values from some range of the Real Numbers, e.g. most physical measurements (height, weight, pressure, time, density, force, etc.)

There are two useful subtypes of continuous quantitative data; interval and ratio, separated by what kind of *scale* is used. 

##### Interval
Interval data is continuous numerical data that describes the difference between things, specified on a scale that is arbitrarily defined in relation to those things. As such, it cannot describe the real ratio between those things. It describes the interval difference between two measurements, but not in relation to absolute amounts because it has an arbitrary position for zero. For example, temperature in celsius is interval data, because the difference between 1C and 5C is 4C, but 5C isn't five times hotter than 1C, though you can say that the difference between 1C and 5C is half the difference between 1C and 9C. 

##### Ratio
Ratio data is continuous numberical data that describes the difference between things, specified on a scale that is non-arbitrarily defined. Specifically, it has a unique, non-arbitrary value for zero. For example, temperature on the kelvin scale, since 0K is no temperature, and 10K is twice as hot as 5K. Almost all physical measurements can be taken on ratio scales. 

### Statistical operations on different types of data
Different types of data allow for different statistical operations. The following table (a combination of three different tables from pages that can be found in my references section, as well as a data visualisation guide from kaggle), displays very useful and practical information about analyses of different types of data, that I will include as a rough summary of useful things to keep in mind: 

|Statistical operation or analytical technique|Nominal|Ordinal|Continuous Interval|Continuous Ratio|
|Equality/Inequality|X|X|X|X|
|Greater than/Less than/Ordering|-|X|X|X|
|Addition/Subtraction|-|-|X|X|
|Relative Multiplication/Division|-|-|-|X|
|Mean|-|-|X|X|
|Median|-|X|X|X|
|Mode|X|X|X|X|
|Quantifiable difference between values|-|-|X|X|
|Bar chart|X|X|-|-|
|Line chart|-|X|X|X|
|Area chart|-|X|X|X|
|Histogram|-|-|X|X|
|Scatter plot|X|-|X|X|
|Hex plot|X|-|X|X|
|Stacked bar chart|X|X|-|-|
|Bivariate line chart|-|X|X|X|
|Count bar chart|X|X|-|-|
|Box plot|X|-|X|X|
|Violin plot|X|-|X|X|

### Further reading
The only further reading I suggest is the following short (and extremely interesting) wikipedia page: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Level_of_measurement, though there are further references at the end of this README.
